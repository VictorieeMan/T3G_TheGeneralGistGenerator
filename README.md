# T3G_TheGeneralGistGenerator
Is it possible to fina a method of programatically generate the gist of a comment section or the replies of a survey? Thie repository is an investigation into that problem.

Our first approach will involve the use of Markov Chains, with the idea that maybe the probabnilities over several entries can be sued to generate an "avreage" entry - What we more casually would call the "gist" of say an online comment field or survey replies.
